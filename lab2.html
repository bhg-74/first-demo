    <section>
    <p>An animal rescue group or animal rescue organization is dedicated to pet adoption. These groups take unwanted,
       abandoned, abused, or stray pets and attempt to find suitable homes for them. Many rescue groups are created
       by and run by volunteers, who take animals into their homes and care for them — including training, playing,
       handling medical issues, and solving behavior problems — until a suitable permanent home can be found.

   <h2>Rescue groups and shelters</h2>
   <p>There are two major differences between shelters and rescue groups. Shelters are usually run and funded by local
      governments.[5] Rescue groups are funded mainly by donations and most of the staff are volunteers. While some 
      shelters place animals in foster homes, many are housed on-site in kennels. Some rescue groups have facilities 
      and others do not. Foster homes are heavily utilized in either case.

      Within the dog rescue community, there are breed-specific and all-breed rescues.[6] As its name implies, 
      breed-specific rescues save purebred dogs of a certain breed, for example, Akitas, Boxers, Dalmatians, Labrador
      Retrievers, etc. Almost every breed is supported by a network of national and international rescue organizations 
      with the goal to save abandoned dogs of this breed. All-breed rescues are not limited to purebred dogs. Instead 
      they save dogs of any breed. Many work with specific shelters to support their efforts.<br></p>

    <p>In the US, there are three classifications for pet rescue:</p>

      <ul class="classifications">
          <li>municipal shelter</li>
          <li> no-kill shelter
              <ul>
                  <li>Adoption programs</li>
                  <li>Retention program</li>
                  <li>Partnering</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Not-for-profit rescue organization</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Adopting through a rescue group</h2>
    <a href="rescuegroups.org" target="_blank">Rescue Group</a>
    <section>
    <p>Most rescue groups use similar adoption procedures, including completing an application, checking a veterinary
        reference, conducting an interview (can be in person or by phone) and a home visit. Rescue organizations are 
        usually volunteer-run organizations and survive on donations and adoption fees.[7] The adoption fees do not 
        always cover the significant costs involved in rescue, which can include traveling to pick up an animal in need
        , providing veterinary care, vaccinations, food, spaying and neutering, training, and more.

        Most animals in the care of rescue groups live with foster home volunteers as members of the family until an 
        appropriate adopter is found. There are a number of different techniques that can be used to make the transition 
        from life at a rescue's foster home to an adoptive home easier on the animal. Generally, rescue groups provide 
        adopters with basic information to aid in a successful transition.
        
        Often, adoption counsellors are involved in the process in order to ensure that the pet is being sent to a good, 
        fitting home. Questionnaires for adoption vary between organizations, but are essentially used to ensure that the
        animal being adopted suits the lifestyle of the prospect owner and will have all of his or her needs fulfilled.</p>

        <h3>Other country</h3>
        <p>The Canadian Federation of Humane Societies accounts for the largest amount of dog and cat shelters in Canada. 
        With 172 shelters throughout the country, it is estimated that 103,000 cats and 46,000 dogs were taken in during
        2013.[8] Of these, 60% of cats and 49% of dogs were strays, 28% of cats and 34% of dogs were surrendered by their 
        owners, 2% of cats and 3% of dogs were cases of abuse, and the rest were either transferred from neighbouring 
        facilities or born in the shelters themselves.
        
        Of the thousands of animals in shelters in Canada in 2013, only 47% of dogs and 45% of cats were adopted. 
        The remaining majority were left to be euthanized, sent back to their previous owners, or stayed in the shelters,
        possibly being transferred from one to another hoping for better outcomes.</p>
